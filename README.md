# my_counter_cubit

A Flutter tutorial application by Your Dev Edge.

## Description

This is a series of tutorials that focuses on State and State Management using the Bloc Package.

This is the first of several "Overview" applications that demonstrate the basics of Cubit/Bloc.

This app will create a simple Counter App (similar to the default app installed by Flutter) that will use Cubit to manage the state/data.
